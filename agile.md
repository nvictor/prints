## grooming

* A grooming session is the "backlog refinement" session. Its goal is to ensure the backlog is clean, organized, and stories are marked ready for future work.

* Unlike "sprint planning", which focuses on planning the next immediate sprint, this session aims to look a few sprints ahead.

* Cooking analogy: grooming is grocery shopping, sprint planning is mise en place, sprint is the cooking.

### what's discussed during grooming

* Reviewing user stories:
    * "Product owner" presents the highest priority items from the backlog that havenâ€™t been fully discussed yet
    * The team asks clarifying questions to understand the "why" behind a story, the intended user value, and the business goals.

* Defining acceptance criteria (AC):
    * The team defines the specific, testable conditions that must be met for a story to be considered "done."

* Breaking down large stories (that don't fit into a single sprint)
    * Generally those are converted to "epics"

* Estimating level of effort (LOE and story points):
    * The team collectively estimates the effort required for each story
    * Techniques like planning poker are often employed, where team members use cards with values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) to vote on the size of a story. Discrepancies in votes lead to valuable discussions about the technical approach.

* Identifying dependencies and blockers:
    * The team identifies any dependencies or blockers that may hinder the progress of the backlog items (external team, specific release, etc.)

* Re-prioritizing the backlog based on grooming discussion
