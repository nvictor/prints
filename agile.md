## grooming

* A grooming session is the "backlog refinement" session. Its goal is to ensure the backlog is clean, organized, and stories are marked ready for future work.

* Unlike "sprint planning", which focuses on planning the next immediate sprint, this session aims to look a few sprints ahead.

* Cooking analogy: grooming is grocery shopping and meal preps, sprint planning is mise en place, sprint is the cooking.

### what's discussed during grooming

* Reviewing user stories:
    * "Product owner" presents the highest priority items from the backlog that havenâ€™t been fully discussed yet
    * The team asks clarifying questions to understand the "why" behind a story, the intended user value, and the business goals.

* Defining acceptance criteria (AC):
    * The team defines the specific, testable conditions that must be met for a story to be considered "done."

* Breaking down large stories (that don't fit into a single sprint)
    * Generally those are converted to "epics"

* Estimating level of effort (LOE and story points):
    * The team collectively estimates the effort required for each story
    * Techniques like planning poker are often employed, where team members use cards with values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) to vote on the size of a story. Discrepancies in votes lead to valuable discussions about the technical approach.

* Identifying dependencies and blockers:
    * The team identifies any dependencies or blockers that may hinder the progress of the backlog items (external team, specific release, etc.)

* Re-prioritizing the backlog based on grooming discussion

## sprint planning

* Explaining goals of the sprint
* Pulling from "ready" stories

## planning poker process

1. Product owner presents story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Team members estimate privately
4. Everyone reveals their estimate simultaneously
5. Differences are discussed:
    1. If estimates are similar, a final number is agreed upon.
    2. If estimates vary widely, the members with the highest and lowest votes explain their reasoning. This discussion is key to uncovering assumptions and sharing knowledge.
6. Team repeats steps 3-5, incorporating the new insights from the discussion.
7. Cycle continues until the team's estimates converge and a consensus is reached.
